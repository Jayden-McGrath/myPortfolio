			<h1>Common Exercies</h1>
				<p>The following are common exercies that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercies routine.
				</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Burpee</dt>
				<dd>Burpees are a great, full body excercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>
				<dt>Plank</dt>
				<dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the positiion as long as you can.</dd>
				
				
				<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>	
				<dd>Mountain climbers are a great cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
